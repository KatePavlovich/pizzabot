## Description

This project was developed for a pizzabot challenge.
Pizzabot - a robot that delivers pizza. 
The task is to instruct Pizzabot on how to deliver pizzas to all the houses 
in a neighborhood. In more specific terms, given a grid (where each point on the 
grid is one house) and a list of points representing houses in need of pizza delivery.  
Script should return a list of instructions for getting Pizzabot to those locations and delivering pizza.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Version

1.0.0

## Requirements

- Node JS 16.14.2 or higher
- npm 7.21.1 or higher

## How to run the app

- clone this repo
- enter cloned repo (ex, in console `cd pizzabot`)
- in the project directory in terminal:
    - install dependencies `npm install`
    - `npm start`


Runs the app in: \
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

There will be an input to type instructions for pizzabot in it

Correct format for instru—Åtions is string, ex. `5x5 (1, 3) (4, 4)`

Where 5x5 is board size and then pairs of coordinates are provided in parentheses

When you type instructions press enter or click `Start delivery` button

The answer and the board should appear and pizzabot will start deliveryüçïüòÉ One by one steps will appear on the screen and if pizzabot reached the point of destination he drops the pizzaüçï
If there are some problems with inserted instructions validation message would appear.

Pizzabot always starts at the origin point, (0, 0). As with a Cartesian plane, this point lies at the most south-westerly point of the grid.

The instruction is one of:
N: Move north
S: Move south
E: Move east
W: Move west
D: Drop pizza
 

For `5x5 (1, 3) (4, 4)` one correct solution would be: ENNNDEEEND

## How to run test

In the project directory in terminal run `npm test`
